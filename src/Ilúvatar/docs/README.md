# High-level Ilúvatar Documentation

## Try it out

Easily set up your machine to run Ilúvatar [here](./SETUP.md), then try out some of our [examples](examples/README.md).
Or start running [your own experiments](./LOAD.md) and making [your own functions](./FUNCTIONS.md) to run inside Ilúvatar.

## Contribute / Development

For starters on how to extend or modify Ilúvatar, see the documentation on [development](./DEV.md).

## Ansible setup

Check out [here](./ANSIBLE.md) for how to use Ansible to simplify deployment of Ilúvatar to one or more nodes.

## Flame graphs

An extension of the logging setup can track function execution times and convert them into flame graphs.
See [here](./FLAME.md) for more details.

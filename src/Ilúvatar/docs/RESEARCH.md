# Research Possibilities

## Advanced Options

All configuration for the worker and controller are located in two central structs, one for each piece.
The [controller is much simpler](../iluvatar_controller_library/src/controller/controller_config.rs) and allows for changing the load balancing algorithm and what load metric might be used to balance invocations.

The [worker configuration](iluvatar_worker_library/src/worker_api/worker_config.rs) has many more options as it can micromanage invocations in many ways.
The primary struct, `Configuration`, contains many sub-structures.
`ContainerResourceConfig` has generic resources the container pool is allowed to use to store running and warm containers.
`ComputeResourceConfig` allows overloading CPU resources, and enabling GPU resources if the hardware is available.
Adjusting the queing policy can be done with `InvocationConfig`.
The network cache pool can be changed with the `NetworkingConfig` struct.

Details are not described here to avoid repeating information that is detailed in the code comments, and preventing inaccurate and out-of-date details.
These config options allow changing how the internals of the worker operate, and can be easily added to and modified.

## Configuration Exploration Experiments

The [paper-repro example](./examples/paper-repro/) runs several simulation experiments and plots the data in the same way Figure 10 of our Il√∫vatar paper.
It runs different queue and resource configurations, easily changable, to explore the state space to test out different settings without large compute usage.

# Trace

Here we run a simple trace against a single worker node.
Ansible has direct access to the local host and can perform all setup and teardown actions without complication.

Make sure you've updated the [host_addresses file](../../../ansible/group_vars/host_addresses.yml) with your machine's networking interface.
Simply execute `./run.sh` to run the example.
